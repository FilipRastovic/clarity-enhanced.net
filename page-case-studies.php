				<p class="font-weight-light">USB Factory is a Swiss based custom USB design manufacturer. Basically companies send them over their logos and USB Factory creates USB drives ( among other things ) with their logos on them.
				Company CEO, Battista, got it touch with me in order to solve one problem: their Unbounce landing pages not converting enough. After checking out their current designs it was obvious to me that their 
				Unbounce landing pages were very outdated, not optimized for conversions and most importantly the design was not aligned with their current website. The conversion rate was something around 
				<span class="font-weight-bold">6%</span>. I got all the copywriting and images Battista wanted me to include in the new landing page and started working. After sending him over the first mockup, he 
				gave me some feedback and I revised the page. The second version was aproved and I started implementing the page onto Unbounce. The page had a custom slider and some nice animations. After the implementation was 
				over, we tested the page on both mobile and desktop. We than started getting paid traffic to the page and the <span class="font-weight-bold">conversion rate doubeled.</span> Their new landing page has more than 
				<span class="font-weight-bold">12% conversion rate.</span>

				<p class="font-weight-light">Customr.app is a Budapest based AI analytics survey app developer. The company CEO wanted a modern looking landing page to help him explain what the application is about and start collecting leads with a form where visitors can sign up for the demo of the app. Robert, the company CEO got in touch with me after searching for a single person to both develop and design him a landing page. We got in touch on skype and after a nice chat he sent me over the pdf abstract document he has put together. It was a complex document that I had to simplify and turn into a website presentation that is user friendly. I then began designing the page following my standard workflow process and sent him over the image files of the initial design. We iterated a few times and eventually created a design that we both liked. I then started coding by forking a bootstrap template with pre built gulpjs configuration and scss partials for efficient development. I coded the static page and then turned it into a WordPress theme, utilizing the Custom Field plugin to allow Robert to change all the content on the page: images that were in the sliders, text in every section and social urls. Robert and I moved into another project after this one, design and development of his personal analytics services company.</p>
