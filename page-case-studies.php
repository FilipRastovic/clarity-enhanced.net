				<p class="font-weight-light">Customr.app is a Budapest based AI analytics survey app developer. The company CEO wanted a modern looking landing page to help him explain what the application is about and start collecting leads with a form where visitors can sign up for the demo of the app. Robert, the company CEO got in touch with me after searching for a single person to both develop and design him a landing page. We got in touch on skype and after a nice chat he sent me over the pdf abstract document he has put together. It was a complex document that I had to simplify and turn into a website presentation that is user friendly. I than began desining the page following my standard workflow process and sent him over the image files of the initial design. We iterated a few times and eventually created a design that we both liked. I then started coding by forking a bootstrap template with pre built gulpjs configuration and scss partials for efficient development. I coded the static page and then turned it into a WordPress theme, utilizing the Custom Field plugin to allow Robert to change all the content on the page: images that were in the sliders, text in every section and social urls. Robert and I moved into another project after this one, design and development of his personal analytics services company.</p>

				<p class="font-weight-light">Justo is a Toronto based real estate agent company that helps its customers buy and sell property
					easily and with a discount. They needed a landing page for their marketing campaign. Justo team sent me over their website to draw design inspiration 
					from and sent me over a wireframe of the landing page they desired. The landing page had a savings calculator that would allow visitors to
					preview how much they would save by buying or selling a property with Justo. I developed a calculator by hand
					using jQuery and designed a page that would capture their leads and easily allow its visitors to get in
					touch with a contact person from Justo team.</p>

					weren't converting as much as they wanted. After a thorough analysis we diagnosed that the pages lacked design polishing. They were ugly
					and unpleasant to the visitors. I applied some basic design principles to these pages such as white-space, harmonizing the typography and 
					 adjusting font weights. After that we tested the pages again and got an astonishing conversion rate of more than 39%!</p>
